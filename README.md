# Chrome Extension Template

A modern template for building Chrome extensions using TypeScript, with a modular architecture and a solid foundation for development. This template is optimized for use with [Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh/) for enhanced development productivity.

## Features

- **TypeScript** for type safety and modern JavaScript features
- **Webpack** for bundling and development workflow
- **Modular Architecture** with separate components for popup, background, and options
- **Ready-to-use UI** with modern styling
- **Storage API** implementation for saving settings
- **Service-based pattern** for API communication
- **Message passing** between components
- **Cursor AI Integration** with intelligent contextual assistance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
- npm (v10.x or later recommended)
- [Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh/) editor (recommended for optimal development experience)

### Installation

1. Clone this template repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsmailKharoub/cursor-ready-chrome-extension-template.git my-extension
cd my-extension
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Build the extension in development mode:

```bash
npm run build
```

Watch mode (automatically rebuilds on changes):

```bash
npm run watch
```

### Loading the Extension in Chrome

1. Build the extension using one of the commands above
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` directory from this project

## Cursor AI Integration

This template includes a `.cursorrules` file that provides intelligent context to Cursor AI about:

- Project architecture and structure
- Extension development best practices
- Decoupling patterns and principles
- Size and performance considerations
- Security guidelines
- Chrome API usage patterns

### Using Cursor AI with this Template

When developing with Cursor AI:

1. **Ask for Implementation Help**: "Generate a feature that saves bookmarks from the current tab"
2. **Get Architectural Guidance**: "How should I structure a content script for this extension?"
3. **Improve Existing Code**: "Refactor this background script to better handle message passing"
4. **Debug Issues**: "Why isn't my chrome.storage code working correctly?"

Cursor AI will use the context from the `.cursorrules` file to provide more accurate and architecturally sound suggestions specific to Chrome extension development.

## Customization

### Extension Information

Edit the `manifest.json` file to change:

- Extension name
- Description
- Version
- Permissions
- Icons

### Add Your Functionality

1. **Background Logic**: Modify `src/background/background.ts` to include your background processing logic
2. **UI Components**: Customize `src/popup` directory files for the extension popup
3. **Settings**: Update `src/options` files to change available settings
4. **Data Models**: Define your data structures in `src/models/types.ts`
5. **API Services**: Implement API calls in the `src/services` directory

## Building for Production

To build for production, simply run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The extension will be compiled to the `dist` directory, ready for publication to the Chrome Web Store.
